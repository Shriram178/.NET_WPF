# WPF Async Programming, Event Handling & Cancellation ‚Äì Deep Dive

This document covers core concepts you need to understand to build responsive and well-structured WPF applications, especially when dealing with asynchronous work and event handling.

## üìå `async`, `await`, and `Task` in WPF

### ‚úÖ What is `async` and `await`?
- Used to perform long-running tasks (like I/O or background processing) **without freezing** the UI.
- `await` lets the UI thread remain **free to respond** while the background work completes.

### ‚úÖ Why use them?
- Prevents **UI freezing** (especially important in desktop apps like WPF).
- Makes code easier to read and write compared to threading callbacks.

### üß™ Example

```csharp
private async void StartWork_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    await Task.Delay(3000); // Simulates background work
    MessageBox.Show("Work completed!");
}
```

## üßµ UI Thread, `Dispatcher`, and Thread Safety

WPF has a **single UI thread**. Background threads **cannot** update UI elements directly. You need to use the **Dispatcher**.

### üß™ Dispatcher Example

```csharp
Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =>
{
    MyLabel.Content = "Updated from background thread";
});
```

## üõë Cancellation with `CancellationToken`

### ‚úÖ What is `CancellationToken`?
- It allows cooperative cancellation between threads.
- Commonly used with async methods to stop long-running operations when needed.

### üß™ Example

```csharp
CancellationTokenSource cts = new CancellationTokenSource();

private async void StartWork_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    try
    {
        await Task.Run(() => DoWork(cts.Token));
    }
    catch (OperationCanceledException)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Operation was cancelled.");
    }
}

private void DoWork(CancellationToken token)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        Thread.Sleep(500);
    }
}
```

## üß† `object sender` and `RoutedEventArgs e`

### ‚úÖ What is `object sender`?
- The **object that raised the event**.
- Helps identify which control triggered the event.

### ‚úÖ What is `RoutedEventArgs`?
- Contains context like the original source of the event.
- Carries data across the **event route** in WPF (tunneling or bubbling).

### üß™ Example

```csharp
private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    Button btn = sender as Button;
    MessageBox.Show($"Clicked: {btn.Content}");
}
```

## üîÅ Routed Events in WPF

### ‚úÖ What are Routed Events?
- Events that **travel through the visual/logical tree**.
- **Tunneling**: from root to source (`PreviewEvent`)
- **Bubbling**: from source to root (`Event`)

### üß™ Hands-On Example

**XAML**:
```xml
<Window ... PreviewMouseDown="Window_PreviewMouseDown" MouseDown="Window_MouseDown">
    <StackPanel PreviewMouseDown="StackPanel_PreviewMouseDown" MouseDown="StackPanel_MouseDown">
        <Border PreviewMouseDown="Border_PreviewMouseDown" MouseDown="Border_MouseDown">
            <TextBlock Text="Click me!" />
        </Border>
    </StackPanel>
</Window>
```

**Code-Behind**:
```csharp
private void Window_PreviewMouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) => Debug.WriteLine("Window ‚Üí Tunneling");
private void Window_MouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) => Debug.WriteLine("Window ‚Üê Bubbling");

private void StackPanel_PreviewMouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) => Debug.WriteLine("StackPanel ‚Üí Tunneling");
private void StackPanel_MouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) => Debug.WriteLine("StackPanel ‚Üê Bubbling");

private void Border_PreviewMouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) => Debug.WriteLine("Border ‚Üí Tunneling");
private void Border_MouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) => Debug.WriteLine("Border ‚Üê Bubbling");
```

### üßæ Sample Output

```
Window ‚Üí Tunneling
StackPanel ‚Üí Tunneling
Border ‚Üí Tunneling
Border ‚Üê Bubbling
StackPanel ‚Üê Bubbling
Window ‚Üê Bubbling
```

### üß† What can we learn from this?
- **Tunneling** goes top-down (parent to child).
- **Bubbling** goes bottom-up (child to parent).
- Helps when handling complex UIs with nested elements (e.g., prevent event propagation).

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Concept                 | Purpose |
|--------------------------|---------|
| `async` / `await`        | Prevent UI freezing while doing background work |
| `Task`                  | Represents a unit of async work |
| `Dispatcher`            | Used to safely update UI from a background thread |
| `CancellationToken`     | Gracefully cancel long-running operations |
| `object sender`         | Identifies which control raised the event |
| `RoutedEventArgs`       | Provides event context (source, route, etc.) |
| Routed Events           | Event routing mechanism (tunneling, bubbling) in WPF |

## ‚úÖ When to Use These in Real Projects?

- **Responsive UI** ‚Üí Use async and Dispatcher to keep things smooth.
- **User Cancellation** ‚Üí Always provide cancel buttons for long tasks.
- **Multiple Controls One Handler** ‚Üí Use `sender` to distinguish.
- **Advanced UI Event Handling** ‚Üí Routed events make it flexible to intercept or modify behavior in parent containers.
